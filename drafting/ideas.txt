fishing game BUT
- you barter fish for materials (and rarer/higher value fish)
-- you use these materials to craft fishing gear
- fishing gear allows new areas to be accessed
-- these areas have different fish that can be traded for other things
- fishing system uses a stamina system (how much you can move the bar)
- little rng, progression is dependent on how long you have grinded + some skill
-- maybe like a really rare secret fish per area for collection (not for progression)
